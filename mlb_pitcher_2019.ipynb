    "# ...(TOPIC: fastball velo itself has little to do with performance, so ...)\n",
    "Fastball is arguably one of the most interesting aspects to watch in a baseball game: no breaking, no change of speed, but simply pure challenge to the batter. People often first associate fastball with its speed, and there are several reasons to it: 1) most professional leagues use different instruments (e.g. radars, cameras) that can detect the speed of a ball, and can exhibit the number to the audiance right after a pitch (mostly on an giant electronic board), so it becomes the most accessible piece of information; 2) speed is one of the easiest statistics to understand and interpret, and it is somewhat relatable to everyday life (e.g. car speed); 3) fastball usually has the fastest speed among all kind of pitches, which produces the greatest number on the electronic board. Think about this, if you are in a Major League baseball game and a pitcher throws a fastball that reaches three digit (over 100 mph), audiance are going to wow at it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As the understanding of kinesiology becomes more advanced these days, athletes are trained to reach beyond their limit that they can never imagine. In baseball, more pitchers are able to throw over 100 miles per hour. However, despite the awe of this speed statistics, is this really guarantee these fireball pitchers to perform well in the league? How about the other pitchers who are not able to throw that fast, are they doomed? Clearly, the answers are no to both questions, since a baseball game is way more complicated to be addressed with just one piece of statistics.   \n",
    "\n",
    "But at the end of the day, why does fastball speed ever matter? And what about those slower-pitching pitchers, how do they survive? This study aims to explore a number of topics: \n",
    "1. Is there any correlation between a fastball speed (average and max) and a performance metric (WHIP)? \n",
    "2. Cluster the pitchers into two categories: fastball-based pitchers and non-fastball-based pitchers, and interpret their data \n",
    "3. ...(for fastball, is there a combination of pitches (e.g. fastball + changeup, different location) that can most efficiently get rid of batters e.g. strike out)\n",

    "Among the four datasets, the major foucs will be `raw_pitches`. This dataset records every pitch/at-bat in the 2019 MLB season, which is identified by a unique at-bat id (`'ab_id'`). However, it does not specify which pitcher/batter was involved in each at-bat. We therefore extract relevant information from `raw_atbats` (`'ab_id'`,`'pitcher_id'`,`'batter_id'`) and merge it to `raw_pitches`. On top of that, we extract names of pitchers from `raw_players` and merge according to the new `pitcher_id` column*. This allows us to only need to use one dataframe in later sections, and it will be assigned to the variable named `df`.  \n",

    "To measure a goodness of a pitcher, there are several useful metrics including ERA (earned run average), FIP (fielding independent pitching), WHIP (walks and hits per inning pitched), and more. This study will use WHIP as the main metric, due to the following reasons:\n",
    "1. The formula of WHIP is relatively simple (mlb.com). The formula is: \n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "WHIP = \\frac{Walks + Hits}{innings\\;pitched}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "which means that a pitcher with a lower WHIP tends to be better, because he allows less walks and hits in the game.\n",
    "2. It targets one of the most fundamental goals of a pitcher: keeping runners off the basepaths (that is, minimize the walks and hits) (mlb.com). \n",
    "  \n",
    "Note that WHIP also has its shortcomings: \"hit batsmen, errors and hitters who reach via fielder's choice do not count against a pitcher's WHIP\" (mlb.com). Nevertheless, WHIP would still be a good and simple starting point to measure the performacne among pitchers. \n",
    "  \n",
    "Below is the plot of pitchers average fastball speed versus WHIP, with the correlation coefficient. \n",
    "Since nan values may exist in the column avg_fastball_speed (for those who did not throw any fastballs), we need to drop the rows before calculating the correlation coefficient."

This suggests that for a pitcher in the MLB, although throwing a very fast fastball has nothing to do with his WHIP score, there is a chance that he tends to get more strikeouts. Again, keep in mind that this relationship neither suggests any cause and effect nor guarantees a better strikeout total."
